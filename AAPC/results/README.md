data name format:
There are multiple data name format:

end with .data.txt is the application standard output.
end with .log is the power log.


1. {benchmark name}_{Total Power Bound}_{per Processer Power bound}_{half dram power bound}_{core number}.data.txt

2. {benchmark name}_{core allocation}_{per processor power bound}.data.txt

3. {benchmark name}_{core allocation}_{cpu core frequency}.data.txt


validate.xlsx contains the results evaluated in the paper "Application-aware power coordination on power bounded numa multicore systems"
